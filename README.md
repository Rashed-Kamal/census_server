- repository for census server side files
- Basically what we are trying do in this project is using our previous census[ https://github.com/Rashed-Kamal/census ] file as a template which was developed for client side static page. Now develop server side dynamic webpage using PHP.
- we will use MySQL for database development. full database schema will be available in this repository. So anyone can test the completed development in thier local machine.
